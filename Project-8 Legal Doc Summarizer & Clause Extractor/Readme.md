## Overview

This application helps legal professionals quickly analyze contracts, case files, and court rulings. It automatically extracts key information — document summaries, critical clauses (Termination, Liability, Jurisdiction, etc.), and named entities (parties, dates, locations, laws) — from unstructured legal text.

The application runs entirely locally, ensuring client confidentiality and eliminating API costs. It uses Ollama to host the LLaMA 2 model, FastAPI for the backend API, and Streamlit for the user interface.

## Features

- **Document Summarization** — Generates plain-language summaries of legal documents
- **Key Clause Extraction** — Identifies and extracts critical clauses:
  - Termination
  - Liability
  - Jurisdiction
  - Payment Terms
  - Confidentiality
  - Indemnification
- **Named Entity Recognition** — Extracts:
  - Parties involved
  - Dates
  - Locations/Addresses
  - Laws and jurisdictions
  - Monetary amounts
- **Export Ready** — Download results for legal workflows

---

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **Python** | Version 3.8 or higher |

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Esha-Mirza/School_Of_AI_Internship.git
cd School_Of_AI_Internship/"Project-8 Legal Doc Summarizer"
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Pull LLaMA 2 Model via Ollama

```bash
ollama pull llama2
```

This downloads the LLaMA 2 model (~3.8 GB). Alternatively, you can use a smaller model:

```bash
ollama pull phi3        # 2.2 GB, faster inference
ollama pull gemma:2b    # 1.4 GB, lightest option
```

## Running the Application

**Terminal 1: Start Ollama Service**

```bash
ollama serve
```

**Terminal 2: Start Backend (FastAPI)**

```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

The backend will be available at: `http://localhost:8000`

**Terminal 3: Start Frontend (Streamlit)**

```bash
streamlit run frontend/app.py
```

The frontend will open at: `http://localhost:8501`

---

## Usage

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`
2. Paste a legal document in the text area or load the sample
3. Click the **Analyze** button
4. View the results in three tabs:
   - **Summary** — Plain-language document summary
   - **Key Clauses** — Extracted clauses with details
   - **Named Entities** — Parties, dates, locations, laws, amounts

## Configuration

### Changing the Model

To use a different model, modify `backend/main.py`:

```python
MODEL = "phi3"           # Change from "llama2" to your preferred model
```

### Changing the Port

**Backend Port** (default: 8000):

```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8001
```

**Frontend Port** (default: 8501):

```bash
streamlit run frontend/app.py --server.port 8502
```

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| Model not found | Run `ollama pull llama2` to download the model |
| Connection refused | Ensure Ollama is running (`ollama serve`) |
| Port already in use | Use `--port` flag to specify a different port |
| Module not found | Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| Slow inference | Switch to a smaller model like `phi3` or `gemma:2b` |
| No results | Ensure the document is not empty and contains legal text |

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add clause-risk flagging (highlight unusually one-sided or non-standard clauses)
- [ ] Add support for multi-document comparison (redlining between contract versions)
- [ ] Add PDF/DOCX direct upload instead of pasted text only
